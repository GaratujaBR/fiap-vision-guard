# FIAP VisionGuard App Flow Document

## Introduction

This document explains the complete flow of the FIAP VisionGuard MVP system. The goal of the system is to test the viability of using artificial intelligence to detect potentially dangerous cutting objects, such as knives and scissors, in recorded videos. The project is designed for educational purposes and for evaluating the alerting functionality after an object is identified. The system uses a pre-existing dataset that may be extended with additional images under various lighting and angle conditions, and the entire process is showcased in a simple and practical way. The solution focuses on processing pre-recorded videos, extracting frames, detecting objects of interest, and issuing an instant alert when needed.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

In this MVP, users are test operators rather than standard end users. When a user first accesses the system, they are greeted by a simple landing page that clearly explains the purpose of the application and provides a streamlined way to access the video upload functionality. Although this project is for testing, the app includes a minimal sign-up process where the user can sign in using their email or an educational account provided for the demonstration. The sign-in process is straightforward: the user inputs their credentials and, once authenticated, is directed to the main interface. If the user forgets their password, a clear recovery link is available on the login page. Since the project is solely focused on the detection workflow, there are no complex levels of access beyond this simple authentication step.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, the user is taken to a clear and minimal main dashboard that serves as the control center for the testing process. The homepage displays the video upload form prominently along with a simple navigation menu. The dashboard also includes log sections where messages about the ongoing processing or alerts are shown in real time. Although there is no need for a complex user interface, the page is designed to be both elegant and functional, in line with the project's requirement for a refined look. From this homepage, the user can proceed to upload a video, check the status of video processing, and inspect logs of detected security events.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once the user uploads a pre-recorded video using the form on the dashboard, the system immediately begins processing the video. The application extracts relevant frames from the video using computer vision techniques powered by OpenCV and sends these frames to a trained model. This model, developed using TensorFlow, has been trained in an environment like Google Colab to identify objects such as knives, scissors, and similar cutting tools. As each frame is analyzed, any detected object triggers the alert mechanism. When an unusual object is identified within any frame, the system generates an alert by sending a notification—this could be in the form of an email, SMS, or even a phone call if configured. The transition from video upload to object detection is seamless: the user uploads the video, and then the application automatically moves to the processing page where logs are updated in real time to reflect the status of each analyzed frame. The user can then view detailed logs indicating exactly which frame contained a potential threat and the corresponding alert that was sent.

The system also integrates supplementary developer tools, such as WindSurf, which assists in writing and organizing the code during the development phase. The training and execution of the detection model happen on platforms like Google Colab, ensuring robust computational power is available without complicating the application's user interface. Testers can easily navigate back to the dashboard after each process to upload new videos or review the alerts that were generated in previous cycles.

## Settings and Account Management

Even though this MVP is focused primarily on detection and alert generation, there is a minimal settings module available for a test user to update basic preferences related to notification methods. On the settings page, users can choose their preferred alert mechanism—such as email, SMS, or phone call—so that the system sends notifications using the chosen method. The account management section allows the user to update personal details, change the password, and adjust notification settings. After making any changes, users can easily navigate back to the main dashboard to continue testing the system. All changes are immediately reflected in the user profile and used by the alert generation function of the application.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

During the process, the system contains clear pathways to manage errors and unexpected situations. For instance, if a user attempts to upload an unsupported file type or if the video does not meet the required format, the system displays a clear error message on the upload page. Errors related to network connectivity or processing delays while extracting video frames are also handled gracefully, with messages that guide the tester on what to do next. When an error occurs during the detection process, such as a failure in running the analysis on a particular frame, the system provides fallback logs with details about the error and instructions for re-uploading or retrying the process. The design ensures that the user always understands where the process is failing and what steps are needed to recover a normal workflow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The complete journey of a tester using the FIAP VisionGuard system starts at a welcoming landing page where the user signs up or logs in using a simple process. Once authenticated, the user lands on a clearly designed dashboard that serves as the control hub for video uploads and operation monitoring. The system then takes the uploaded video and processes it automatically, extracting frames and analyzing them with a trained AI model to detect dangerous cutting objects. Upon detection, an alert is immediately generated and sent using the chosen notification method. Throughout the process, clear error messages and log updates help the user follow every action from upload to alert generation. By ensuring a smooth, step-by-step flow from onboarding through detailed processing and error management, the application provides an intuitive and comprehensive environment for validating the feasibility of its detection features.
